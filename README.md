# Physball

Physball is a level-based, physics-based 3D puzzle platformer written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/), using
the [Bevy Engine](https://bevy.org/). Physball started as a test game written in Bevy, called ball-thing. Ball-thing was
just an experiment of rolling a ball around a 3D physics world that unintentionally followed in the steps of *many*
other Marble Blast clones.

## Playing the Game

You can play the game in your browser at [physball.app](https://physball.app/). You can also download non-browser
versions of the game over on the [releases page](https://github.com/Kneelawk/physball/releases).
